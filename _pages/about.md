Hello! I am a third-year PhD student of Operations Research at [Cornell University](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie), where I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Damek Davis](https://damek.github.io/). 

I am interested in studying the mathematics of data science, especially the interplay of optimization, statistics, machine learning and numerical linear algebra. During my PhD, Damek and I have been developing and analyzing a fast condition-number-free algorithm for a wide family of non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. I am very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Steve Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home), and we are studying the mathematics of sum-of-norms clustering. I also have the privilege to work with Professor [Anil Damle](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/), and we have been exploring the stereotyping problems in spectral embeddings.


I received my degree of MMath in Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo, where I had the privilege to be advised Professor [Steve Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home) on sum-of-norms clustering for my [thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16279). 
<!-- We have prvoed the [recovery theory](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-218/19-218.pdf), proposed an [early-stopping test](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=31ZXjswAAAAJ&citation_for_view=31ZXjswAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C) and invented leapfrog distance to boost the performance of sum-of-norms clustering. -->
Prior to my graduate studies, I obtained my BEng in Engineering Systems and Design at Singapore University of Technology and Design, where I met and worked with several wonderful professors including Professor [Peter Jackson](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/peter-jackson), [Selin Ahipasaoglu](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5y9p9p/doctor-selin-ahipasaoglu), [Sergey Kushnarev](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/sergey-kushnarev/) and [James Wan](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/james-wan).


Outside of office, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and taking photos of the beautiful people around me.
