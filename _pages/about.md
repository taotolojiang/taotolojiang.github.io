Hello! I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Cornell ORIE advised by Professor [Damek Davis](https://damek.github.io/). I am actively working with my wonderful mentors [Lin Xiao](https://linxiaolx.github.io/index.html) and [Sho Yaida](https://www.shoyaida.com/) from FAIR to develop efficient optimizers, study scaling laws and analyze natural data structure in the context of deep learning. 


I received my degree of MMath in Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo, where I had the privilege to be advised Professor [Steve Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home) on sum-of-norms clustering for my [thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16279).
<!-- We have prvoed the [recovery theory](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-218/19-218.pdf), proposed an [early-stopping test](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=31ZXjswAAAAJ&citation_for_view=31ZXjswAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C) and invented leapfrog distance to boost the performance of sum-of-norms clustering. -->
Prior to my graduate studies, I obtained my BEng in Engineering Systems and Design at Singapore University of Technology and Design. 

<!-- where I met and worked with several wonderful professors including Professor [Peter Jackson](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/peter-jackson), [Selin Ahipasaoglu](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5y9p9p/doctor-selin-ahipasaoglu), [Sergey Kushnarev](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/sergey-kushnarev/) and [James Wan](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/james-wan). -->


Outside of office, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing and going out for adventures with my partner Zhi (click out his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zhil_photos/) for beautiful photos we took during our trips). If you have a keen interest in promoting fairness within societal systems and are contemplating potential solutions, please check out some fascinating work by [Zhi](https://zhiliu724.github.io/) and see how he identifies and addresses disparities using quantitative methods.
