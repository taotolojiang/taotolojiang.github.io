Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Foundamental AI Research (FAIR) in Meta, hosted by [Lin Xiao](https://linxiaolx.github.io/index.html). My research interests lie in the intersection of deep learning, optimization and statistics. I develop theory and methodologies to advance training and inference efficiency and performance for AI models. For training efficiency, we designed efficient and robust optimization algorithms (such as [BCOS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08963)) that achieve comparable performance as Adam but requires less memory and fewer hyper-parameters. For inference efficiency, I am developing principled algorithms for model pruning and quantization that achieve maximum inference efficiency.

I recently got my PhD in Operations Research at Cornell University, advised by [Damek Davis](https://damek.github.io/). Prior to that, I received MMath in Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo, advised by [Steve Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home), and BEng in Engineering Systems and Design at Singapore University of Technology and Design.

Outside of office, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing and going out for adventures with my husband [Zhi](https://zhiliu724.github.io/).
