Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Foundamental AI Research (FAIR) in Meta, hosted by [Lin Xiao](https://linxiaolx.github.io/index.html). My interests broadly lie in the intersection of optimization, statistics and probability in the context of machine learning. I develop efficient optimization algorithms for complex learning tasks.

I recently got my PhD in Operations Research at Cornell University, advised by [Damek Davis](https://damek.github.io/). Prior to that, I received MMath in Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo, advised by [Steve Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home), and BEng in Engineering Systems and Design at Singapore University of Technology and Design.

Outside of office, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing and going out for adventures with my husband Zhi. If you have a keen interest in promoting fairness within societal systems and are contemplating potential solutions, please check out some fascinating works by [Zhi](https://zhiliu724.github.io/) and see how he identifies and addresses disparities using quantitative methods.
